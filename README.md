# JonCraft Official Resource Pack

All of this Resource pack automatically gets included in the server (it doesn't yet but soon will) so keep that in mind

### Guide

The `assets/minecraft` directory has all the data you need with `assets/minecraft/textures/entity` having creature textures, the rest is self-explanatory.

Keep your textures to its vanilla resolution unless you have a valid reason for having it be higher (you can only use powers of two for texture sizes so keep that in mind).

Minecraft's music is stored in the `.ogg` file format so you might have to use a converter for that.

also I know that storing binary files on a GitHub repository is bad practice but DropBox is bloat and this is the best alternative
